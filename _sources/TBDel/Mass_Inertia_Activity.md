# Overview of Practice Activity

<img src="Figures/Problem2.png" height=300 width=300>

The figure above shows a composite system made up of three slender rods; the total mass of this system is $M$. For this system, you are to derive the inertia matrix of the system about the point O; that is, determine all the 9 elements of $[{\bf I}]^{S/O}$. Recall that:

$[{\bf I}]^{S/O} = \begin{bmatrix}
I^{S/O}_{xx} & I^{S/O}_{xy} & I^{S/O}_{xz} \\
I^{S/O}_{yx} & I^{S/O}_{yy} & I^{S/O}_{yz} \\
I^{S/O}_{zx} & I^{S/O}_{zy} & I^{S/O}_{zz}
\end{bmatrix} $

where the diagonal elements are moment of inertia scalars and off-diagonal elements are product of inertia scalars.

So, your task reduces to calculating each of these terms and  assembling it in a matrix using sympy's `Matrix` feature.


__<span style="background-color:cyan">IMPORTANT:</span>__ You are to store your inertia matrix solution in the variable name `I_matrix_of_S_about_O`.

__Hints:__
1. $M$ will be useful to determine the mass of individual sections of the composite system.

2. To support your calculations, you are provided  the some information regarding the inertia scalars of a slender rod about its mass center ($G$ in the figure):
<img src="Figures/slender_rod_moi.png">
The figure above essentially tells you that the moment of inertia scalar about G in a direction perpendicular to rigid rod's length is $\frac{1}{12}$(mass of the rod)$\cdot$(length of the rod)$^2$.

Additionally, you are also told that, for this slender rigid rod in the figure: 
- the moment of inertia about G of along its length is zero.
- the products of inertia about G in all directions are all zero.
