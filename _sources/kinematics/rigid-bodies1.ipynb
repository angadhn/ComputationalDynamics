    "Translation: the motion of $B$ in $A$ is a translation if and only if any straight line segment embedded in $B$ remains parallel to itself when observed from $A$ when $B$ moves in $A$. If this condition is not met, then we have to consider the motion as rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple rotation: the motion of $B$ in $A$ is a simple rotation if and only if there exists a unit vector $\\hat{n}$ that remains fixed in both $B$ and $A$, as $B$ moves in $A$. Examples in figures below:\n",

    "Here, $\\hat{b}_y$ is a unit vector that is fixed in both $B$ and $A$. Using our definition for simple rotation tells us that $\\hat{b}_y$ is $\\hat{n}$. So, in mathematical notation, we can say:\n",

    "---\n",
    "name: 17\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But we must now pause to ask ourselves if there is any other unit vector that is also fixed in both $B$ and $A$? It turns out that there is, indeed, another one fixed in both $B$ and $A$: $\\hat{a}_y$.\n",

    "So far, we have written the vectors $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{e}$, in terms of the $B$ frame. As a result, they were not functions of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressing the vectors in the unit vectors attached to the A frame requires us to derive relationships between $\\hat{a}_i$ and  $\\hat{b}_i$:\n",

    "From the second of Equations in $1$, we have $\\vec{e} = -e\\hat{b}_y$.\n",

    "$\\theta$ in the prior example is an angle that describes the orientation of $B$ relative to $A$ (and vice versa). Thus, it is also called an angular position. Other common ways of referring to it are _orientation angle_ or _attitude angle_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we come to a more involved example, where we will express $\\vec{v}$ in terms of the unit vectors of the $A$ frame using the first of Equations $1$ as the starting point:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{v} = v\\hat{b}_x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now examine the relationships between the unit vectors by drawing only the unit vectors with the vector $\\hat{n}$ out of the plane (see figure below this passage). We can then derive the following relationships by examining the lower figure,  comprising only unit vectors:\n",

    "Now, we have derived the complete relationships between the unit vectors that make up the $B$ frame in terms of the unit vectors of the $A$ frame.\n",

    "We can take this work one step further and write the relationships in matrix form as follows:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that: $\\hat{b}_y=\\hat{a}_y$\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, this can be interpreted to mean that the door B swings relative to the wall $A$ about the $\\hat{b}_y$-axis, which also coincides with the $\\hat{a}_y$-axis. In other words, this represents what is known as a simple rotation about the $y$-axis. Similar relationships can also be derived for simple rotations about $x$-axis or $z$-axis. "
