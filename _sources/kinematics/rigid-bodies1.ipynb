    "# Rigid Body Kinematics\n",
    "Kinematics or Rigid body kinematics is the study of motion while ignoring the cause of motion. In kinematics, we are interested in \"position\", \"velocity\", and â€œacceleration\" and the relationship between them. Therefor, in a physical sense, we are interested in describing the motion of $B$ in $A$ (see {numref}`rigid_body_intro`).\n",

    "Broadly, there are two classifications for rigid body motion:\n",
    "- __Translation__: the motion of $B$ in $A$ is a translation if and only if any straight line segment embedded in $B$ remains parallel to itself when observed from $A$ when $B$ moves in $A$. If this condition is not met, then we have to consider the motion as rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Simple rotation__: the motion of $B$ in $A$ is a simple rotation if and only if there exists a unit vector $\\hat{\\bf n}$ that remains fixed in both $B$ and $A$, as $B$ moves in $A$. Examples in figures below:\n",
