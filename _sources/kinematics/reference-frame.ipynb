For the sake of the next discussions on how reference frames relate to each other, we now also introduce a right-handed set of unit vectors for frame $ A: \\: \\hat{\\bf a}_x,\\;\\hat{\\bf a}_y\\:\\&\\:\\hat{\\bf a}_z$. We will work with this example in our next Jupyter Notebook, which is our first Practice Activity specifically pertinent to our discussion on dynamics.\n",
