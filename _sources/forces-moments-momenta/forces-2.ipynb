    "Now, evaluating this integral is quite challenging. So can we come up with a much simpler expression for evaluations the angular momentum of a body? Indeed, this is possible. Let’s see how we can do this$\\ldots$\n",

    "Now, we can quite easily observer that this cross product is, in fact, the angular momentum of the mass centre $B^*$ about the point $O$ in the frame $N$. In other words,\n",

    "$^{N}H^{B/B^{*}}$ is frequently called the central angular momentum; central refers to the calculation of angular momentum being done about the mass centre. Further, it can also be shown that the central angular momentum is easily calculated by the following formula:\n",

    "This says that the central angular momentum is given by the product of the inertia matrix of $B$ about $B^*$ and the angular velocity of $B$ in $N$; this proof is not shown here. In summary, we can see that this second integral highlighted in pink eventually yields:\n",

    "Equation $10.4$ is called the __Transfer theorem for angular momentum__. This is because it allows us to calculate the angular momentum of a body about any point external to the body by transferring to its centre of mass and then to the point of interest. \n",

    "### Special case\n",
